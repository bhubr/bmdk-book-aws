# BMDK Book to AWS

This repo is based on code described in the excellent [Bootstrapping Microservices with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform](https://www.manning.com/books/bootstrapping-microservices-with-docker-kubernetes-and-terraform?query=microservices) book, published by Manning.

The book's original code examples are to be found under the [Bootstrapping Microservices organization on GitHub](https://github.com/bootstrapping-microservices).

Why, you may ask, brew my own code? That's because the book's examples rely on Azure, and I intended to use AWS.

I'll try to add chapter-by-chapter instructions.
